### Concurrency

> Concurrency is a design pattern, a way to write code: even with one cpu one can write concurrent code.
> Concurrency does **not** guarantee parallelism!

### Parallelism

> Jobs running at the SAME time, not in sequency!
> With multiple cores, a concurrent code can run in parallel.
