# fbac's go-learning readme

## Disclaimer

This repository is not intended to be a professional documentation source or anything like that.

It's just a collection of exercises, examples, tips, tricks and good practices I've collected since I started learning go years ago.1

Since my brain has volatile memory I like to have collections like this to perform braindumps from time to time, and if in the process it helps somebody I'd be happy.

## TODO

Maybe a go course for beginners in the future? ðŸ¤”
