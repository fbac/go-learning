/*
	Channels

	When writing concurrent code (maybe parallel when using multiple cpu's),
	where multiple foroutines are in action and the program doesn't have
	a single running thread, then thereÂ´s a need of controlling how the data
	flows and communicate form goroutine to goroutine.

	We introduce channels to control how this data is shared between different goroutines.

	Go Proverb: "Don not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating."
